
Good morning, in our group we have set out to solve the challenge of migratory trips, choosing a species, in our case, the humpback whale, studying its migration routes
and also creating a visual and interactive tool, i.e a simple app able to 
show the user of the app the place where the whales are migrating in a certain time. The app is very basic but
from this idea, one could even design a higher and more advanced edition with more species, and as a last result,
from the information gathered from all species, one could even study the past consequences of climate change on species
and to anticipate future ones.

First, the resource used to create the app has been MIT App Inventor 2. It has been chosen because it is used to
create apps without having to program or have very basic knowledge of programming, being a newness. From the
choice of it, we chose a minimalist design, with possibility of editing, to be very visual and easy to use, with specific selections for the user.

Secondly, the block code of the app itself was elaborated to make the different functions of the app work.
The data obtained to locate the whales has been taken of the links of the own page of the NASA and of outer pages,
comparing different data for them to be reliable.

Finally, in addition to the functions of detecting the moves of humpback whales, with their relevant description, it will be also avalaible
the option of GPS and share in social networks.

You will have the link of the app, and to open it you should go to the page of App Inventor 2 and import the file that is attached.

We would like to highlight the value of the project since none of the members of the group have previous programming knowledge
and we have been able to develop a simple application that works. It has been an achievement, and a pleasure at the same time to work for NASA for the first time.
